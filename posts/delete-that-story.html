		<h1>Delete that story</h1>
		<p>... and maybe your Icebox.</p>
		<p>
			What is an Icebox? In product development an Icebox is exactly what it
			sounds like, stories are "put on ice" and preserved in their current form
			until a later date when the work is a priority. This could be okay, or it
			may conjure images of basement freezers full of expired fish sticks. This
			brings a question to mind, why not just buy the fish sticks when you need
			them?
		</p>
		<p>
			Iceboxes are often the result of the same fear that drives the "data"
			market, good ideas are hard to come by and they could be hiding anywhere,
			so forget the word delete and save everything. The problem with this logic
			is that good ideas stand out, but they don't stop there. A good idea will
			present itself more than once and often from different sources. A
			Designer, Accountant, and Developer all have the same idea weeks apart, it
			might be worth looking at.
		</p>
		<p>
			So what am I suggesting?
			<strong
				>Whenever you are tempted to move a story to the Icebox, delete it
				instead.</strong
			>
			Here are three thoughts that may ease the anxiety that comes with that
			decision.
		</p>
		<h2>1. It's probably not important</h2>
		<p>
			If you're worried that the story you're deleting could be important,
			remind yourself that putting it in the Icebox means its not important
			enough to play now. Something that's not important enough to work on now
			likely won't be important months from now in the very same way.
		</p>
		<h2>2. Good ideas will come up again</h2>
		<p>
			A good idea is never truly lost. Others will often have the same idea
			again in the future, likely at a more appropriate time. Even more likely
			if the idea is good you won't forget it.
		</p>
		<h2>3. Products change</h2>
		<p>
			When you put a story on ice, you are documenting a potential feature with
			the current state of the product in mind. Months from now the product has
			changed and your story is likely no longer relevant, either lumped into
			another feature or non applicable due to state of the product.
		</p>
		<h2>4. Other tools are good too</h2>
		<p>
			When the time comes to store information long term, such as contacts,
			legal, timeline, and more, It's important to remember that It's alright to
			use tools other than your project management.
		</p>
		<p>
			I'm not telling you to go and delete your icebox right this second,
			instead I hope that next time you move a story to the icebox you will
			consider why. Also remember, if what you're doing works for you, keep
			doing it.
